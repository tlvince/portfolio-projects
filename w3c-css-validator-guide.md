The **W3C CSS Validator guide** provides a simple walk-through to build the W3C
CSS validation service from its source.

In collaboration with the developers of [MarkupValidator][] for the second time,
I wrote the guide to be as simple and accessible as possible. I used a
[Vagrant][] managed virtualised environment in order to guarantee
reproducibility and handed the guide back to the community via an open source
license.
