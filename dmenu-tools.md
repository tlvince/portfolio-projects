**dmenu-tools** is a collection of scripts powered by [dmenu][].

This project aims to provide a community-driven suite of useful dmenu utilities.
Each script is written in pure POSIX for greater portability. True to the "[suck
less philosophy][philosophy]", the scripts focus on simplicity, clarity and
frugality.
