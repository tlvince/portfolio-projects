The **W3C Validator guide** provides a simple walk-through to build the W3C HTML
validation service from its source.

Written in collaboration with the developers of [MarkupValidator][] from a
Gun.io open source gig, I used [Vagrant][] to manage a virtualised environment
in order to guarantee reproducibility.
