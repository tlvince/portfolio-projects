The **W3C Validator Guide** provides a simple walk-through to build the W3C HTML
validation service from its source.

Written in collaboration with the developers of [W3CLove][] from a [Gun.io
open source gig][gun.io], I used [Vagrant][] to manage a virtualised environment in
order to guarantee reproducibility.
