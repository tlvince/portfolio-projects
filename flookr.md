flookr is a Flickr/Google Maps mashup.

Written in early 2010, `flookr` introduced me to the world of web apps.
Aggregating many open source services, I used server-side scripting to serve
dynamic content from *Flickr*. From given search terms, geo-tagged photos are
displayed on a *Google Map* and within a *JQuery*-powered gallery.
