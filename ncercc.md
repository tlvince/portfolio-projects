**NCERCC** is an independent partnership of knowledgable and experienced
residential chld care practitioners, delivering evidence and experience informed
leadership for improvements in policy and practice.

In collaboration with [IntelliMedia][], I help take the project from an early
protoype to a fully realised product. Key responsibilities included repurposing
and extending the site's content management system, adding dynamic page elements
and launching the completed site.
