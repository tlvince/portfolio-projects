**Periodical** is a Kindle periodical generator.

Periodical turns cluttered webpages into clean, distraction-free articles
suitable for reading on an e-reader.

Under the hood, it integrates [boilerpipe][] for content extraction and
[kindlegen][] to create a pleasant, newspaper-like ebook. Example Linux scripts
are provided for 'Send-to-Kindle' functionality.
