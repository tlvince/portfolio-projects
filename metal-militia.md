**Metal Militia** was a band community website.

Co-formed with Robert Hicks in 2005, we created a web portal for bands in the
local area. With as many as 20 bands in its hayday, we provided shared web
hosting, design and a forum, building a strong community for music discussion.

The project initiated my love for web development. From humble beginnings with
Microsoft Frontpage, I had learnt the fundamentals of HTML, server
administration and security principles.
